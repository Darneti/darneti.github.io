	    <h1><span>From the Author</span></h1>
	    <p>Hello dear readers, we are all familiar with such genres as fantasy and fantasy. Someone - read, someone - watched, someone - heard, someone - played, but everyone was somehow acquainted with the wonderful creations of these genres. Today it will be about "Popadantsy". In most cases, these are ordinary people, like us, with you, accidentally thrown into this or that world. Almost in all the works of such unfortunate people, they are transferred where they could not be in the forbidden place, where the local people do not kick, they get there a magic power that no one has had for thousands of years and begin to quarrel with the powerful of this world. And to do this quite successfully and sometimes even conquer whole kingdoms or destroy worlds. But no one writes what would happen to the average person who got into this situation in reality. There is a simple question "Why?". The answer is very simple and I will try to convey it to you, at least from my point of view. You, probably, are already tired of reading my reasoning on this matter, so that, as they say "Less lyrics and more work." Let's get started. 
</p>
	    <h1>True, the fate of his partner</h1>
	    
	    <h2>Kyiv on May 22, 2015.</h2>
	    
		<p>It was a beautiful sunny day. Winter cold long ago, the spring came into law A beautiful sunny day. Winter cold has long since passed away, spring has entered into legal rights. Andrei Skorokhod after a day's work, hurried to meetings with friends and comrades. He worked as an IT specialist, in a small office and as most of these people were lover of a second beer in a good company.
		</p>

<br>
<strong>**************</strong>
<br>

        <p>Arriving at the meeting place, Andrei saw that there were no friends and decided to take a bottle of pivas. Getting nannym, went to the side lit a cigarette and waited for the pack to catch up the rest.
          - Health Skorokhod - Andrei turned, in front of him stood Vitka "Bouillon". This guy did not get an ordinary nickname on vacation, when he was running around the campground at 4 am from hunguana and begging for all the chicken soup, for it's too bad, there are no strengths to endure, and you do not particularly drunk while driving, as a result, angry ladies poured out that most broth on his head, they say, do not FIG on this early to run around other people's tents and say thank you that husbands on the head did not snooze - And where is everyone?
          - Toha wrote that he will be late, the rest will soon be.
          - I'm sure I'll go and I'll take a beer.
          After half an hour all were in the collection.
        </p>
 
<br>
<strong>**************</strong>
<br>
        <p>
            I threw myself, as always, on the most I can not. The weather for a couple of three hours was spoiled specifically. Wind, lightning and thunder. "It's good there's no rain," Andrei thought, when everyone left.
          -Taxi what to call - he said aloud - And I do not care to get far on foot.
          The weather was getting worse, there was a fine rain, lightning flashed all over, and the impression was created that the discharges hit the ground, very close. There was a thunder, the thunder was loud, the air was filled with static electricity, the guy had his hair standing on end, and one after another the three strongest strikes struck Skorokhod directly into the crown of his head, not a particularly stupid head.
        </p>
<h2>It is not known where. It is unknown when.</h2>
        <p>
           Andrew woke up in the middle of the forest, brutally sick of the turret, but no alcohol in one eye, as if he did not drink at all. Holding his head, he felt a sticky slime, a hard bolt and not a single hair. Immediately came the memory of the thunder and lightning striking guy. Raising his head, he saw four moons.
         - Yes, that your mother is happening - He cried out, a lot of stories about other worlds popped up in his memory - How can this ever happen ... (Then five minutes is not a printed word).
         In other matters, this is all that our hero managed to do, for the scream came, a furry animal unknown to science and was reinforced by the violator of silence.
        </p>
<h1>END</h1>
        <p>
          Approximately so I imagine the fate of the poor fellow who was brought into the dangerous jungles of another's world. Of course, the circumstances and places can be quite different, but the result is always the same. And it's good if at least later the bones remain, for future generations. After all, an untrained individual, especially without means of survival (knife, matches, strong and comfortable clothes ...), is unlikely to survive in harsh conditions among many predators, even in his own world, not to mention the unfamiliar beast of a stranger.
        </p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <p>
        Thank you, my dear.
          For the time you spent,
          to read this work.
          I hope it was not in vain and someone,
          something, yes I took it.
        </p>
